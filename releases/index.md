# v1.1

## Changes

### Assignments
- Modified first assignment to reflect what we covered in the first
  class

### Lessons
- _Introduction_
  - modified to move git / GitHub information before R / RStudio
  information
  - small edits for clarity

### Overview
- fixed error so syllabus PDF is now at top of page

### Schedule
- typo fix

### Start
- added **Issues** section with information about setuping git on
  Windows

### Other
- added **Releases** page to footer
- changed links in footer
- removed date of change from section footer since it wasn't updating
  as planned and therefore wasn't useful (it updated everywhere with
  each site build rather than as a page actually changed)

# v1.0
## Initial release

Site as built for first class on 7 January 2020
