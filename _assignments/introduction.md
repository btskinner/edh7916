***NOTE** This assignment needs to be completed by the start of the
second class. That means everything pushed to you remote GitHub repo
before class starts.*

In this first assignment, I’m asking you to do three things:

1.  Make sure you’ve got your computer set up for class with all
    required software loaded and working.  
2.  Learn a little about Markdown, a plain text syntax that can make
    nicely formated documents.  
3.  Practice using the git / GitHub version control system.

## Steps

1.  If you weren’t able complete all the setup during class time, be
    sure that you have done so and everything is in working order. Set
    up a time to meet with me this week if you are having issues.

2.  As I mentioned in class, Markdown is a useful plain text markup
    language (meaning you format your document by including special
    syntax directly in your text rather than, say, clicking a button
    like with MSWord). We will use it throughout the semester.
    
    To get some background information, read the Getting Started page
    ([www.markdownguide.org/getting-started](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started))
    for general information about Markdown. Also look through the guide
    at
    [www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
    for the basic Markdown syntax.

3.  Initialize a file called `introduction_hw_<your_last_name>.md` in
    your `/working` directory. (**NB** Notice the file ending of `*.md`
    — this is a Markdown-style plain text file.).
    
    You can do this directly in RStudio by:
    
    1.  Clicking the *New file* icon in the upper left corner and
        selecting **Text file**.
    2.  Click the *Save* icon, change the name as required, change the
        save location to the `/working` folder, and save. Don’t forget
        to add the `.md` to the end. You will know you’ve done it
        correctly if the tab with your file name changes to include an
        icon that looks like a sheet of paper with an “MD” superimposed
        on it.

4.  Within your file, please include the following:
    
      - A top-level (h1) header with the assignment name
    
      - The following sentence in which one word is **bolded**, one is
        *italicized*, and one is ***bold italicized***:
        
        > In God we trust. All others must bring data.
    
      - An unordered list of 3-5 book titles (italicized) with author
    
      - An ordered list of the order of operations for using git /
        GitHub before each class and work session
    
      - A block quote of a favorite short quote (including attribution)
    
      - A code block with the code `x <- 1` inside

5.  Check that your file builds correctly using RStudio’s *Preview*
    button. You’ll see that a `*.pdf` or an `*.html` verson of the file
    will be saved in your folder, depending on whether you selected to
    *Preview HTML* or *Preview PDF* if you clicked the downarrow instead
    of the button directly (default if you click the button should be
    `*.html`). You should stage, commit, and push these files in
    addition to the working `*.md` file.

6.  As you’re working, take the following steps to add/stage, commit,
    and push your work to your repo using the **Git** tab in the upper
    right frame:
    
    1.  **Stage** your changes to your file by clicking the button next
        to the file.
    2.  **Commit** your changes with a short but informative message.
    3.  **Push** your commit to GitHub.
    4.  Log into the GitHub website, navigate to your repo, and confirm
        that you can see your changes.

Remember, you can do these steps as many times as you want. I would
encourage you to commit smaller changes and push to your remote GitHub
repo often rather than wait until the last minute.
