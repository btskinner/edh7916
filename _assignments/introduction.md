***NOTE** This assignment needs to be completed by the start of the
second class.*

1.  If you don’t complete all the setup during class time, do the
    following:
    1.  Download and install all required software.
    2.  Register for GitHub and submit an request for an education
        discount.
    3.  Send me your GitHub ID.
    4.  Clone your repo (`student_<your_last_name>`) to your machine — I
        recommend saving inside another directory where you store class
        files, *e.g.*, `~/courses/edh7916/student_<your_last_name>`.
2.  Initialize a script called `introduction_hw_<your_last_name>.r` in
    your `/scripts` directory.
3.  Read through the supplemental material on [**Data types and
    structures**](https://edquant.github.io/edh7916/lessons/types_structures.html)
    and answer the “Quick exercises” in your script.
4.  At the bottom, add a commented note on what you hope to accomplish
    in this course and any concerns you may have.
5.  Making sure you’ve saved your file, take the following steps to add,
    commit, and push your work:
    1.  `git add` your changes to your repo.
    2.  `git commit` your changes with a short but informative message.
    3.  `git push` your commit to GitHub.
    4.  Log into the GitHub website, navigate to your repo, and confirm
        that you can see your changes.
