For this week’s assignment, I want you to start an RMD file for your
final project. I recommend starting with `test_score.Rmd` as a template.
In your RMD file, you should attempt to:

1.  Read in your data
2.  Wrangle/clean your data
3.  Make/output any tables you may have
4.  Make/output any figures you may have

The good news is that whatever code you’ve written so far to accomplish
these tasks can go directly into your document (no need to reinvent the
wheel\!).

If you have thoughts about your analysis (*i.e.* what you might write in
a report), go ahead and add them as markdown between your code chunks.
Basically, begin working on your reproducible report.

My recommendations:

1.  **Start slow.**
    1.  Start with `test_score.Rmd`, rename, move to your
        `final_project` folder.
    2.  Next try reading in your data, once accomplished, then clean,
        then make figure, *etc*.
2.  Compile to PDF or HTML often; this will help you find your errors
    along the way.

Push whatever you try in a file called `final_project.Rmd` in your
`final_project` folder by start of class next week.
