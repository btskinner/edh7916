# Overview

Higher education researchers have a wide variety of quantitative tools
at their disposal. Yet as the number and sophistication of these tools
grows, so too do expectations about the quality of final
analyses. Furthermore, increasing scrutiny of non-replicable results
demands that researchers follow a proper workflow to mitigate
errors. In this course, students will learn the fundamentals of a
quantitative research workflow and apply these lessons using common
open-source tools. We will cover project organization, data cleaning,
and exploratory analyses as well as how to run basic econometric
models and recover estimates for publication. Time and interest
permitting, students will also cover some special coding and/or data
gathering techniques. Throughout, students will use coding
best-practices so that their workflow may be shared and easily
reproduced.
