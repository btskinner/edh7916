# Overview

Higher education researchers have a wide variety of quantitative tools
at their disposal. Yet as the number and sophistication of these tools
grows, so too do expectations about the quality of final
analyses. Furthermore, increasing scrutiny of non-replicable results
demands that researchers follow a proper workflow to mitigate
errors. In this course, students will learn the fundamentals of a
quantitative research workflow and apply these lessons using common
open-source tools. We will cover project organization, data cleaning,
and exploratory analyses as well as how to run basic econometric
models and recover estimates for publication. Time and interest
permitting, students will also cover some special coding and/or data
gathering techniques. Throughout, students will use coding
best-practices so that their workflow may be shared and easily
reproduced.

## Objectives

Students will learn:

1. To use a number of tools that are useful for conducting applied
quantitative research, including:  
  - R w/ RStudio
  - git w/ GitHub 
  - R Markdown
2. To properly organize a project for maximum clarity and
   reproducibility  
3. Best practices for cleaning/tidying/wrangling raw data into analysis-ready data


## Required tools, software, and registrations

Students will be expected to bring a laptop to class. It does not
matter whether the machine runs MacOS, Windows, or Linux; however, the
student’s machine needs to be relatively up to date and in good
running order. It needs to be able to connect to the internet during
class.

All software is freely available. Students need to download and
install a few programs on their machine. See [getting started]({{
site.baseurl }}/start) to find links for all required downloads.

Students also need to sign up for a [free GitHub
account](https://github.com/join) if they haven’t already. Students
should sign up using their University of Florida email address and
request an [education
discount](https://education.github.com/benefits). Both processes are
easy, and the second gives you access to free private repositories.

## Texts 
### Required
All necessary materials are at this website or can be
downloaded from external sources. There are no required text books for
the course.  

### Recommended 
Students may find some of the following books / online resources
helpful: 

- Chacon, S., & Straub, B. (2014). [Pro git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). Apress.  
- Healy, K. (2018). [Data visualization: A practical
  introduction](https://socviz.co). Princeton University Press.
- Wickham, H., & Grolemund, G. (2017). [R for data science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz). O’Reilly
  Media.

## Assignments

- **Class participation (25%):** We will use class time to work through
  lesson modules together. Students are expected to follow along
  with the presentation and run code on their own machine. Students
  are also expected to answer questions and work through example
  problems throughout the class session.
- **Problem sets (50%):** Every lesson module will end with a set of
  questions that students must answer. Students can work together to
  solve the problem sets, but everyone must submit their own work and
  do their best to give accurate attribution for borrowed/repurposed
  code. In general, problem set answers will need to be submitted via
  GitHub a week after they are assigned.
- **Reproducible report (25%):** Students must produce a 3-5 page report on
  a higher education topic of interest. The report should be a
  combination of writing, tables, and figures, have minimal citations,
  and be fully reproducible with minimal effort. Students must use
  publicly available data.
  
## Grading

Requirements for class attendance and make-up exams, assignments, and
other work in this course are consistent with university policies that
can be found [here](
https://catalog.ufl.edu/ugrad/current/regulations/info/attendance.aspx).
Grades are assigned in accordance with current UF grading policies,
which may be found [here](
https://catalog.ufl.edu/ugrad/current/regulations/info/grades.asp)

## Honor code 

UF students are bound by The Honor Pledge which states, 

> We, the members of the University of Florida community, pledge to
> hold ourselves and our peers to the highest standards of honor and
> integrity by abiding by the Honor Code. On all work submitted for
> credit by students at the University of Florida, the following pledge
> is either required or implied: “On my honor, I have neither given nor
> received unauthorized aid in doing this assignment.”  

The [Honor Code](http://www.dso.ufl.edu/sccr/process/student-conduct-honor-code/)
specifies a number of behaviors that are in violation of this code and
the possible sanctions. Furthermore, you are obligated to report any
condition that facilitates academic misconduct to appropriate
personnel. If you have any questions or concerns, please consult with
the instructor or TAs in this class.  

## Accommodations 

Students with disabilities who experience learning barriers and would
like to request academic accommodations should [connect with the
disability Resource
Center](https://disability.ufl.edu/students/get-started/). It is
important for students to share their accommodation letter with their
instructor and discuss their access needs, as early as possible in the
semester.  

## Course evaluations 

Students are expected to provide professional and respectful feedback
on the quality of instruction in this course by completing course
evaluations online via GatorEvals. Guidance on how to give feedback in
a professional and respectful manner is available
[here](https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students/). Students will be
notified when the evaluation period opens, and can complete
evaluations through the email they receive from GatorEvals, in their
Canvas course menu under GatorEvals, or
[here](https://ufl.bluera.com/ufl/). Summaries of course evaluation
results are available to students
[here](https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public-results/).
