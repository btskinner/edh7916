# Describe the issue
Give a clear description of the problem you are having. Be sure to show both your code and the output error message. When showing your code and the error, be sure to wrap it in backticks (```, three above and three below) so that it's formatted correctly:
 
**NOT**

df <- df %>% select(col1)

**BUT RATHER**

```
df <- df %>% select(col1)
```

# Tag others

If you want to ask others, use the **@team_everyone** tag to send everyone an email. You can also **@** specific classmates using their GitHub user name.
