You'll need to download and install a few programs on your computer
for this course. You'll also need to register for a GitHub
account. All software and registrations are free.

## Software links

Unless you have experience building from source, select the binary
download that matches your operating system (_e.g._, Windows, MacOS, or
Linux). Some links take you to the same page. In that case, make sure
you select the correct version for your operating system.

Unless you have a particular reason against doing so, I recommend
installing everything using the default options presented during the
installation processes.

## GitHub registration

If you don't already have one, you'll also need to sign up for a [free
GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if they havenâ€™t already. You
should sign up using your University of Florida email address and
request an [education
discount](https://education.github.com/benefits). Both processes are
easy, and the second gives you access to free private repositories.


## Optional

Throughout the class, we'll use RStudio to interact with
git/GitHub. But there are many ways to use git / GitHub, some of which
you may like better. On one extreme, you can interact with git using
the terminal prompt (Windows users need a slightly modified setup):

```bash
# pull from remote
$ git pull

# add/commit/push changes to remote
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "fixing coding error in clean_data.r"
$ git push -u origin master
```

There are many other GUI (point and click) applications that you can
use as well. Here are a couple you might try:

- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)  
- [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com)
