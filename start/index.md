You'll need to download and install a few programs on your computer
for this course. You'll also need to register for a GitHub
account. All software and registrations are free.

## Software links

Unless you have experience building from source, select the binary
download that matches your operating system (_e.g._, Windows, MacOS, or
Linux). Some links take you to the same page. In that case, make sure
you select the correct version for your operating system.

## GitHub registration

If you don't already have one, you'll also need to sign up for a [free
GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if they havenâ€™t already. You
should sign up using your University of Florida email address and
request an [education
discount](https://education.github.com/benefits). Both processes are
easy, and the second gives you access to free private repositories.
