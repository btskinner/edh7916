Students are expected to complete the following assignments as part of
the course. 

## Class participation

We will use class time to work through lesson modules
  together. Students are expected to follow along with the
  presentation and run code on their own machine. Students are also
  expected to answer questions and work through example problems
  throughout the class session. Class participation is worth 25% of
  the final grade.
  
## Problem sets

Every lesson module will end with a set of questions that students
  must answer. Students can work together to solve the problem sets,
  but everyone must submit their own work and do their best to give
  accurate attribution for borrowed/repurposed code. In general,
  problem set answers will need to be submitted via GitHub a week
  after they are assigned. Problem sets are worth 50% of the final
  grade.
  
## Reproducible report (25%)

Students must produce a 3-5 page report on a higher education topic of
  interest. The report should be a combination of writing, tables, and
  figures, have minimal citations, and be fully reproducible with
  minimal effort. Students must use publicly available data. The
  reproducible report is worth 25% of the final grade.
