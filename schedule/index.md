This semester, we will take lessons in order, but not necessarily
complete them in the same week we start them. Instead, we'll go
through them at them pace that best fits the course. Here are the
topics we'll cover together (and their corresponding assignment number):

**Assignments are due before class in the week after we finish a
lesson**

In addition, we'll have a number of self-directed lessons that each
student will select among to work on during class time based on their
research interests. These include:

- Inferential I: Correlations, _t_-tests, and weights
- Inferential II: Regression and prediction
- Data visualization with ggplot2 II
- Interactive graphics
- Functional programming II
- High performance R with Rcpp
- Web scraping in R
- Introduction to mapping in R

Along the way, you'll have parts of your final project due. These are
due on the following weeks/dates:

| Week                     | Final project component due              |
|:-------------------------|:-----------------------------------------|
| **Week 4** <br/> (1/31)  | < Final project: proposal                |
| **Week 10** <br/> (3/14) | **SPRING BREAK**            |
| **Week 11** <br/> (3/21) | < Final project: initial set of analyses |
| **Week 15** <br/> (4/11) | < Final project: draft of final report   |
| **Week 16** <br/> (4/25) | > Presentations                          |
| **FINALS** <br/> (5/2)   | < Final project: final report            |
