href="https://github.com/edquant/edh7916/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+is%3Aopen" data-size="large"

If you have a question about the course, please file an <a
class="github-button" href="https://github.com/edquant/edh7916/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+is%3Aopen"
aria-label="Issue edquant/edh7916 on GitHub">Issue</a> on our course
site's GitHub repository. This will allow others --- who likely have a
similar question --- to see and even participate in the discussion and
resolution.

Questions about all aspects of the course are fair game, including
lessons and assignments. You can even submit suggestions and general
interest notes (FYIs). 

To help organize everything, I've included the following labels on the
issues page:

<div id="gitlabels"></div>

When you ask a question, try to tag with one of the labels so that
it's easy to search for later. For example, if you have trouble
installing git on your computer, you might tag your question with the
**Question**, **Subject: Git/GitHub**, and **OS: Windows** labels.

Remember that others can search these (that's the whole point) so try
to give your question or suggestion a useful name.

One last note: when looking at past issues, be sure to look at both
the [Open](https://github.com/edquant/edh7916/issues) and
[Closed](https://github.com/edquant/edh7916/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
issues. A closed issue is just one that has been answered and may have
the answer you need.
