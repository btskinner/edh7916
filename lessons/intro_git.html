  <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system
designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
speed and efficiency.</p>

<h2 id="why-use-git">Why use git?</h2>

<p>With so many other (read: easier!) ways to share and collaborate on
documents, why use git? Isn’t it a bit overkill to learn an entirely
new syntax? Why not just email files or use something like DropBox?
Because it is very easy to end up with something like this:</p>

<h3 id="as-complexity-increases-so-does-the-need-for-git">As complexity increases, so does the need for git</h3>

\[Project = f(size, scope, collaborators)\]

<p>As any part of that function grows, so too does the need for a work flow that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Allows for many moving parts</li>
  <li>Allows for peaceful collaboration (no overwrites)</li>
  <li>Allows for timely collaboration (synchronous)</li>
  <li>Allows for distant collaboration (centralized file location)</li>
  <li>Allows for version control (so you can go back if necessary)</li>
</ul>

<p>Git was designed to do all these things, so it works better than other systems.</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-difference-between-git-and-github">What’s the difference between git and GitHub?</h3>

<p>Yep, you guessed it. Git is the system/language that supports version
control. GitHub is an online service that will host your remote
repositories, for free if public or a small fee if private. (Students
get an education discount and some free repos. Check out
<a href="https://education.github.com/">https://education.github.com/</a>.)</p>

<p>RStudio is nice because it provides an nice point-and-click interface
for git. (<a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com">Sourcetree</a> and <a href="https://desktop.github.com">GitHub
Desktop</a> are also really nice GUIs.) If
you want to run git at the command line, go for it! But
using RStudio or another GUI is fine.</p>

<h3 id="some-notes-on-work-flow-good-habits">Some notes on work flow (good habits)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Always <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pull</code> from your local repo with your remote repo before
starting any work. This makes sure you have the latest
files. RStudio has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pull</code> button in the <strong>Git</strong> tab.</li>
  <li>Don’t wait to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">push</code> your commits. Just like you save your papers
every few lines or paragraphs, you should push to your remote
repo. This way, you’re less likely to lose work in the event of a
computer crash. Also, should you want to return to a prior version,
small changes make it easier to find what you want.</li>
  <li>Add useful <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commit</code> messages. RStudio will make you add
something. Don’t say “stuff.” A version history of 95 “stuff”s is
pretty non-helpful. Also, I would keep it clean. Even in a private
repository, work as if someone will see what you write someday.</li>
  <li>Don’t freak out! If you accidentally push and overwrite or delete
something on the remote, you can get it back. That’s the point of
version control! Sometimes weird things like merges happen (two
files with the same name are shoved together). They can be a pain
to fix, but they can be fixed.</li>
  <li>Avoid tracking overly large files and pushing them to your remote
repository. GitHub has a file size limit of 100 MB per file and 1
GB per repo. The history of large files compounds quickly, so think
carefully before adding them. Usually this means that small
datasets are okay; big ones are better backed up somewhere else and
left on your machine.</li>
  <li>Remember: even in a private repository, your files are potentially
viewable. If any of your datasets or files are restricted, do no
push them remotely. Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code> to make sure that git doesn’t
track or push them.</li>
</ol>

<p>Every class and work session should go like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pull</code> from GitHub remote</li>
  <li><em>do work</em></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stage</code> (if new file)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commit</code> with message</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">push</code> back to GitHub remote</li>
</ol>

<p>If you’d like you can also use terminal commands to accomplish the
same things. Many people (including me) like to use the terminal
commands directly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pull: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git pull</code></li>
  <li>Stage: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add &lt;filenames&gt;</code></li>
  <li>Committ: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit -m "&lt;your message here&gt;"</code></li>
  <li>Push: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push</code></li>
</ul>

<p>That said, you should use whatever works best for you.</p>

<p>By far the most useful guide to working with R and git/GitHub is
<a href="https://happygitwithr.com/">Jenny Bryan’s guide</a>. In fact, we’ll use
it first to set up your user credentials so you can interact with
GitHub.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="quick-exercise">Quick exercise</h4>
  <p><a href="https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html#tldr">Using these instructions from Jenny Bryan’s
site</a>, let’s set up a 
Personal Access Token or PAT that you’ll save to your machine.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="some-more-notes-on-using-git-plain-text">Some more notes on using Git: plain text</h3>

<p>Git works best with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text">plain text
files</a>. This is because it
notes the differences across two plain text files rather than just
copying and re-copying the same file over and over again as it
changes. When you’ve only changed one word, git’s method of version
control is much more efficient than making a whole new copy.</p>

<p>It’s also useful when you need to merge two files. If file B is just
file A with new section, file B can be easily merged into file A by
inserting the new section — just like you would add a paragraph in a
paper you’re writing. R scripts are plain text. Some data files, like
*.csv, are plain text. This is why git works really well with data
analysis workflows.</p>

<p>On the other hand, git does not work as well with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file">binary
files</a>. These files are
stored in a format closer to what your computer understands, which
comes with benefits. Data files, like Stata’s *.dta and R’s *.Rdata,
as well as MS Office files — *.docx, *.xlsx, *.pptx, <em>etc</em> — are
binary files. Git will keep track of your MS Word document, but due to
its underlying structure, you won’t be able to merge and every small
change will just make a whole new copy of the file. This is why we
generally don’t commit large binary data files to Git: your repo just
becomes larger and larger with each small change to your data.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="not-so-quick-exercise">Not-so-quick exercise</h4>
  <p>In this first exercise, we’ll practice using RStudio to pull down
your student repository from GitHub. We’ll also practice making a
few quick file changes, staging, commiting, and pushing them back to
the remote.</p>
